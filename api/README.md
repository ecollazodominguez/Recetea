# RECETEA API

This is the API for the Recetea Web from this repository. It is a microservices API where in this case we have 2 services.

- [User Service](Recetea_users_service/) - Users REST API
- [Recipe Service](Recetea_recipe_service/) - Recipes REST API

The API was made with Java Spring Boot, in order to make the backend run, you need to have Java 11+ and JDK 11+.

For running use your prefered IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, etc...). Run both services and your backend will be ready.
