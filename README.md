# INSTALL

If you want to test the web in your own computer you can do it!
All you need to do is clone this repository on your computer and make sure that you have `Node.js, Java JDK v11+ and MySQL` already installed.

First of all you have to run the `API Services`, for that go to the [API](api/) folder and you will find the services. You will need to run every service with your `prefered IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, etc...)`.
